<p>SGML <small>is used to specify</small>  DTDs (document type definitions). A DTD defines a kind of document, such as a report, by specifying what elements must appear in the document and by giving rules for the use of document elements.</p>
<p> Such as that a paragraph may appear within a table entry but a table may not appear within a paragraph. A marked-up text may be analyzed by a <span>parsing program</span>  to determine if it conforms to a DTD.</p>
